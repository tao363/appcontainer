  "text": "The user said \"nihao\" which is Chinese for \"hello\". I should respond in a friendly, concise way. Since this is just a greeting, I don't need to do any file operations or complex tasks.\n\nLooking at my instructions, I should keep responses short and concise. I'll respond briefly in English since the CLAUDE.md mentions \"project documentation may be in Chinese\" but the code comments and logs are in English.",
